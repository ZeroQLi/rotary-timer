# Rotary Timer
## **Official submission for the Coding with Lewis [hackathon](https://hackathon.lewismenelaws.com/)**

Want to start a timer but for some odd reason want to go back to the 90's? too. Well your in luck

## Manual configuration steps:

### 1. Clone the repo
``gh repo clone ZeroQLi/rotary-timer``

### 2. install dependencies (using pnpm)
``pnpm install``

### 3. run dev server
``pnpm run dev``

### 4. Mention me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeroQLi) saying why on earth did you do this.
